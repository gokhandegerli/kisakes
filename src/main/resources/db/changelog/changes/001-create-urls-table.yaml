              Create a partitioned 'urls' table for time-based data management.
              Partitioning by 'created_at' allows for efficient querying and maintenance of large datasets.
            sql: |
              CREATE TABLE urls (
                  id UUID NOT NULL,
                  version INTEGER NOT NULL,
                  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
                  deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
                  short_code VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
                  original_url VARCHAR(2048) NOT NULL,
                  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
                  click_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
                  CONSTRAINT pk_urls PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at) -- Partition key must be part of the primary key
              ) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

              -- Create a NON-UNIQUE index for fast lookups by short_code. Uniqueness is handled by the lookup table.
              CREATE INDEX idx_urls_short_code ON urls (short_code);

              -- Create an index on the partition key for better partition management and range queries
              CREATE INDEX idx_urls_created_at ON urls (created_at);
